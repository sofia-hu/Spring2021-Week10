# MUSA 650: Machine Learning in Remote Sensing

## Week9: Deep Learning - Part2

This repository contains multiple DL examples to present a selection of different components and variations of DL applications. We will let the intuition guide us in each example, aiming to have a "high-level" understanding of the general concepts.
