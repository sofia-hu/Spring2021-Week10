# MUSA 650: Machine Learning in Remote Sensing

## Week10: Deep Learning - Part3

This class will start with a "tutorial session" that covers the most important concepts of DL.
We will than see examples of different DL architectures

- [SHIPS segmented using a Convolutional Neural Net (CNN)](DLBasics_SHIPS.ipynb)
- [What does a convolutional layer do?](DL_VisConvFilters.ipynb) (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vgg-16-cnn-model)
- [Using pre-trained models](DLBasics_TransferLearning.ipynb)
