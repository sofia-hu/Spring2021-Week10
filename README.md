# MUSA 650: Machine Learning in Remote Sensing

## Week10: Deep Learning - Part3

This class will start with a "tutorial session" that covers the most important concepts of DL.
We will than see examples of different DL architectures

- [Understanding back-propagation](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-backpropagation-algorithm-7bb3aa2f95fd)
- [Understanding activation functions](https://medium.com/the-theory-of-everything/understanding-activation-functions-in-neural-networks-9491262884e0)
- [What does a convolutional layer do?](DL_VisConvFilters.ipynb) (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vgg-16-cnn-model) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmpDIaiMIeA)
- [Data augmentation](DLBasics_KerasDataAugmentation_Application.ipynb)
